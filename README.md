# Toxicity Detection and Analysis of Influence Operations on Twitter

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for detecting and analyzing toxic tweets associated with **influence operations (IOs)** on Twitter. The notebooks cover automatic toxicity detection and comparative analysis between toxic and non-toxic tweet behavior from suspected IO accounts.

## Notebooks

- **`Toxic Perspective.ipynb`**  
  Detects the toxicity level of tweets using the Perspective API or a comparable model.

- **`Toxic Analysis 1.ipynb`**  
  Analyzes **toxic and non-toxic tweets** from IO accounts—looking at patterns and content.

- **`Toxic Analysis 2.ipynb`**  
  Analyzes **toxic and non-toxic tweets** from IO accounts—looking at patterns and engagement.
